            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p >
                    Sarojini Naidu 13 February 1879 ,2 March 1949 was an Indian political activist and poet who 
                    served as the first Governor of United Provinces, after India's independence. She played an important
                    role in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj. She was the first Indian woman to
                    be president  of the Indian National Congress and appointed as governor of a state.

            <h2>political Career</h2>
            <p>
                Beginning in 1904, Sarojini Naidu emerged as a prominent orator, passionately advocating for Indian
                independence and women's rights, particularly emphasizing the importance of women's education. Her
                speeches often followed the five-part rhetorical structures of Nyaya reasoning. In 1906, she delivered
                influential addresses at both the Indian National Congress and the Indian Social Conference in Calcutta.
                Recognized for her social activism, Naidu was awarded the prestigious Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1911 for
                her efforts in flood relief. However, she later returned this honor in protest against the April 1919
                Jallianwala Bagh massacre, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to justice and human rights.
